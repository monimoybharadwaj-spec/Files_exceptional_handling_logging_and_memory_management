On the other hand, compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution, which makes them faster but less flexible since they need to be recompiled for different systems. Examples of interpreted languages include Python and JavaScript, while C and C++ are common compiled languages."

It primarily uses reference counting, where each object keeps track of how many references point to it, and objects with zero references are deleted.
